This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The package manager I used was NPM. This site's stack is react and a node.js server hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Routing is currently handled with a catch all but I would like to improve upon this. DNS through GoDaddy.
